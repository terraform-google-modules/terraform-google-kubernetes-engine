  The network configuration of the pool. Such as configuration for Adding Pod IP address ranges to the node pool. Or enabling private nodes.
    - create_pod_range: Whether to create a new range for pod IPs in this node pool. Defaults are provided for pod_range and pod_ipv4_cidr_block if they are not specified.
    - enable_private_nodes: Whether nodes have internal IP addresses only.
    - pod_ipv4_cidr_block: The IP address range for pod IPs in this node pool. Only applicable if createPodRange is true. Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. /14) to have a range chosen with a specific netmask. Set to a CIDR notation (e.g. 10.96.0.0/14) to pick a specific range to use.
    - pod_range - The ID of the secondary range for pod IPs. If create_pod_range is true, this ID is used for the new range. If create_pod_range is false, uses an existing secondary range with this ID.
    - additional_node_network_configs - We specify the additional node networks for this node pool using this list. Each node network corresponds to an additional interface.
      - network - Name of the VPC where the additional interface belongs.
      - subnetwork - Name of the subnetwork where the additional interface belongs
    - additional_pod_network_configs - We specify the additional pod networks for this node pool using this list. Each pod network corresponds to an additional alias IP range for the node.
      - subnetwork - Name of the subnetwork where the additional pod network belongs.
      - secondary_pod_range - The name of the secondary range on the subnet which provides IP address for this pod range.
      - max_pods_per_node - The maximum number of pods per node which use this pod network.
    - pod_cidr_overprovision_config  - Configuration for node-pool level pod cidr overprovision. If not set, the cluster level setting will be inherited.
      - disabled - Whether pod cidr overprovision is disabled.
    - network_performance_config - Network bandwidth tier configuration.
      - total_egress_bandwidth_tier - Specifies the total network bandwidth tier for the NodePool. Valid values include: "TIER_1" and "TIER_UNSPECIFIED".
