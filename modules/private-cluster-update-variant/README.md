# Terraform Kubernetes Engine Module

This module handles opinionated Google Cloud Platform Kubernetes Engine cluster creation and configuration with Node Pools, IP MASQ, Network Policy, etc. This particular submodule creates a [private cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters)
The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:
- Create a GKE cluster with the provided addons
- Create GKE Node Pool(s) with provided configuration and attach to cluster
- Replace the default kube-dns configmap if `stub_domains` are provided
- Activate network policy if `network_policy` is true
- Add `ip-masq-agent` configmap with provided `non_masquerade_cidrs` if `configure_ip_masq` is true

Sub modules are provided from creating private clusters, beta private clusters, and beta public clusters as well.  Beta sub modules allow for the use of various GKE beta features. See the modules directory for the various sub modules.

## Private Cluster Endpoints
When creating a [private cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters), nodes are provisioned with private IPs.
The Kubernetes master endpoint is also [locked down](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#access_to_the_cluster_endpoints), which affects these module features:
- `configure_ip_masq`
- `stub_domains`

If you are *not* using these features, then the module will function normally for private clusters and no special configuration is needed.
If you are using these features with a private cluster, you will need to either:
1. Run Terraform from a VM on the same VPC as your cluster (allowing it to connect to the private endpoint) and set `deploy_using_private_endpoint` to `true`.
2. Enable (beta) [route export functionality](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/private-clusters#master-on-prem-routing) to connect from an on-premise network over a VPN or Interconnect.
3. Include the external IP of your Terraform deployer in the `master_authorized_networks` configuration. Note that only IP addresses reserved in Google Cloud (such as in other VPCs) can be whitelisted.
4. Deploy a [bastion host](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-bastion-host) or [proxy](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/creating-kubernetes-engine-private-clusters-with-net-proxies) in the same VPC as your GKE cluster.

If you are going to isolate your GKE private clusters from internet access you could check [guide](https://medium.com/google-cloud/completely-private-gke-clusters-with-no-internet-connectivity-945fffae1ccd) and [repo](https://github.com/andreyk-code/no-inet-gke-cluster)

## Node Pool Update Variant

In [#256] update variants added support for node pools to be created before being destroyed.

Before, if a node pool has to be recreated for any number of reasons,
the node pool is deleted then, created. This can be a problem if it is the only node pool in the GKE
cluster and the new node pool cannot be provisioned. In this scenario, pods could not be scheduled.
[#256] allows a node pool to be created before it is deleted so that any issues with node pool creation
and/or provisioning are discovered before the node pool is removed. This feature is controlled by the
variable `node_pools_create_before_destroy`. In order to avoid node pool name collisions,
a 4 character alphanumeric is added as a suffix to the name.

The benefit is that you always have some node pools active.
We don't actually cordon/drain the traffic beyond what the GKE API itself will do,
but we do make sure the new node pool is created before the old one is destroyed.

The implications of this are that:

- We append a random ID on the node pool names (since you can't have two simultaneously active node pools)
- For a brief period, you'll have 2x as many resources/node pools
- You will indeed need sufficient IP space (and compute capacity) to create both node pools

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12. If you haven't
[upgraded][terraform-0.12-upgrade] and need a Terraform
0.11.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.11.x is [3.0.0].

## Requirements

Before this module can be used on a project, you must ensure that the following pre-requisites are fulfilled:

1. Terraform and kubectl are [installed](#software-dependencies) on the machine where Terraform is executed.
2. The Service Account you execute the module with has the right [permissions](#configure-a-service-account).
3. The Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine APIs are [active](#enable-apis) on the project you will launch the cluster in.
4. If you are using a Shared VPC, the APIs must also be activated on the Shared VPC host project and your service account needs the proper permissions there.

The [project factory](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory) can be used to provision projects with the correct APIs active and the necessary Shared VPC connections.

### Software Dependencies
#### Kubectl
- [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases) 1.9.x
#### Terraform and Plugins
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12

### Configure a Service Account
In order to execute this module you must have a Service Account with the
following project roles:
- roles/compute.viewer
- roles/container.clusterAdmin
- roles/container.developer

- roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
- roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin (only required if `service_account` is set to `create`)

Additionally, if `service_account` is set to `create` and `grant_registry_access` is requested, the service account requires the following role on the `registry_project_id` project:
- roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin

### Enable APIs
In order to operate with the Service Account you must activate the following APIs on the project where the Service Account was created:

- Compute Engine API - compute.googleapis.com
