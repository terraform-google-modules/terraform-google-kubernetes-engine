# Terraform Kubernetes Engine ASM Submodule

This module installs [Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs) (ASM) in a Kubernetes cluster.

Specifically, this module automates installing the ASM Istio Operator on your cluster ([installing ASM](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/install))

## Usage

There is a [full example](../../examples/simple_zonal_with_asm) provided. Simple usage is as follows:

```tf
module "asm" {
  source           = "terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google//modules/asm"

  project_id       = "my-project-id"
  cluster_name     = "my-cluster-name"
  location         = module.gke.location
  cluster_endpoint = module.gke.endpoint
}
```

To deploy this config:
1. Run `terraform apply`

## Requirements

- Anthos Service Mesh [requires](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/gke-install-existing-cluster#requirements) an active Anthos license.
- GKE cluster must have minimum four nodes.
- Minimum machine type is `e2-standard-4`.
- GKE cluster must be enrolled in a release channel. ASM does not support static version.
- ASM on a private GKE cluster requires adding a firewall rule to open port 15017 if you want to use [automatic sidecar injection](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/proxy-injection).
- Only one ASM per Google Cloud project is supported.
